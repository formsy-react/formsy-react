_( what is the feature, or what is it this is PR fixing? )_

- [ ] Title is human readable, as it will be included directly in `CHANGELOG.md` when we do a release
- [ ] If this is a new user-facing feature, documentation has been added to `API.md`
- [ ] Any `dist/` changes have not been committed.

Tests run directly on the source code and all dist changes are computed and committed during Formsy release.
